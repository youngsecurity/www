## Executive Summary

Zero Trust security is becoming a priority across industries, but security and risk leaders (CISOs and others) face significant challenges in achieving **visibility** into these environments. Zero Trust assumes no implicit trust—every user, device, and network segment must be continuously verified and monitored. This paradigm shift introduces technical hurdles, organizational changes, and strategic considerations that affect all industries. Below, we outline common challenges in gaining visibility under a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), followed by industry-specific insights for finance, healthcare, and government. Each section is supported by recent findings (2023–2025) from experts, surveys, and case studies.

## Technical Challenges in Zero Trust Visibility

Zero Trust often increases architectural complexity, which can create **visibility gaps** and blind spots for security teams. Key technical challenges include:

- **Blind Spots in Encrypted and Internal Traffic:** Zero Trust encourages widespread encryption and micro-segmentation, but this can hinder visibility into lateral (East–West) traffic and internal system interactions. In a 2024 hybrid cloud security survey, 80% of organizations said _gaining visibility into lateral East–West traffic and encrypted data flows is a top priority_ ([Hybrid Cloud Security Trends 2024  Gigamon](https://www.gigamon.com/campaigns/hybrid-cloud-security-survey.html#:~:text=This%20survey%20reveals%20vulnerabilities%20in,traffic%20as%20a%20top%20priority)). Nearly **70% of CISOs report struggling with encrypted traffic**, recognizing that threats can lurk undetected in protected channels ([Hybrid Cloud Security Trends 2024  Gigamon](https://www.gigamon.com/campaigns/hybrid-cloud-security-survey.html#:~:text=CISOs%20are%20alerted%20too%20late,being%20able%20to%20access%20applications)). These blind spots make it harder to detect lateral movement by attackers or policy violations inside the network.

- **Monitoring Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Environments:** Modern enterprises use a mix of on-premises, cloud, and containerized environments. Each platform generates its own logs and telemetry, making unified monitoring difficult. **Cloud complexity is increasing risk** for 8 in 10 organizations ([Hybrid Cloud Security Trends 2024  Gigamon](https://www.gigamon.com/campaigns/hybrid-cloud-security-survey.html#:~:text=This%20survey%20reveals%20vulnerabilities%20in,traffic%20as%20a%20top%20priority)), and many admit uncertainty about their ability to monitor critical areas across clouds. For example, **over one-third of companies lack adequate visibility into user behaviors and application events in multi-cloud identity systems** ([According to Cloud Security Alliance Survey More than Half of  CSA](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/press-releases/2024/10/30/csa-finds-technical-debt-as-top-hurdle-to-identity-system-modernization#:~:text=%2A%20Visibility%20gaps%20in%20multi,policies%20are%20applied%20and%20enforced)). Disparate cloud tools and consoles lead to silos, where security teams cannot easily get a single view of all network segments, user sessions, and data flows.

- **Tool Sprawl and Integration Issues:** Implementing Zero Trust often involves deploying multiple new tools (for identity, network segmentation, endpoint security, etc.). Many organizations now suffer from **“tool sprawl” – 69% of security leaders are overwhelmed by the number of security tools** they must manage ([Hybrid Cloud Security Trends 2024  Gigamon](https://www.gigamon.com/campaigns/hybrid-cloud-security-survey.html#:~:text=Image%3A%20icon)). Without interoperability, these tools produce fragmented data. **Fragmented toolsets and data silos result in inconsistent, incomplete views of the environment**, making it hard to correlate events and spot attacks in real time ([The Secret to Reducing Compliance Risk in Financial Services: Visibility  Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/blog/security/secret-to-reducing-compliance-risk-financial-services-visibility#:~:text=A%20primary%20challenge%20for%20financial,systems%20at%20any%20given%20time)). In fact, existing security tools are falling short: a recent study found that organizations detected only **1 in 3 breaches** with their current toolsets, and 25% couldn’t even identify the breach’s root cause or respond in real time ([Hybrid Cloud Security Trends 2024  Gigamon](https://www.gigamon.com/campaigns/hybrid-cloud-security-survey.html#:~:text=Despite%20efforts%20organizations%20make%20to,or%20respond%20in%20real%20time)). This underscores the need for better-integrated visibility solutions.

- **Asset and Device Visibility:** Zero Trust demands knowing and monitoring every device and account on the network, but maintaining an up-to-date inventory is challenging. The rise of IoT and OT (Operational Technology) devices expands the attack surface. A federal report noted that one of the most **vexing requirements** in meeting Zero Trust goals is _“inventory and monitor the increasingly complex IT landscape”_ spanning traditional IT, OT, and IoT devices ([Federal agencies face zero-trust cybersecurity crunch as OMB deadline looms  FedScoop](https://fedscoop.com/federal-agencies-face-zero-trust-cybersecurity-crunch-as-omb-deadline-looms/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20more%20vexing,The%20convergence%20of%20data%20and)). If organizations _“don’t know every device connected to [the] network,”_ those unknown assets become dangerous blind spots ([Overcoming the Challenges of Clinical Zero Trust  Claroty](https://claroty.com/blog/overcoming-the-challenges-of-clinical-zero-trust#:~:text=healthcare%20more%20broadly%2C%20is%20blindspots,controls%20to%20fully%20protect%20and)). Many enterprises use multiple Identity Providers (IDPs) or asset management systems, which complicates tracking—**75% of organizations manage two or more IDPs**, and 65% say that enforcing consistent security policies across these disparate identity systems is a top concern ([According to Cloud Security Alliance Survey More than Half of  CSA](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/press-releases/2024/10/30/csa-finds-technical-debt-as-top-hurdle-to-identity-system-modernization#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20with%20two,systems%20is%20a%20top%20concern)) ([According to Cloud Security Alliance Survey More than Half of  CSA](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/press-releases/2024/10/30/csa-finds-technical-debt-as-top-hurdle-to-identity-system-modernization#:~:text=%2A%20The%20double,their%20ability%20to%20monitor%20and)). In short, the technical complexity of heterogeneous environments and the lack of unified visibility tooling make it difficult to see everything happening in a Zero Trust architecture.

## Organizational Challenges for Visibility

Beyond technology, CISOs face **organizational and human factors** that limit visibility in Zero Trust deployments. These include:

- **Skill Gaps and Limited Expertise:** Adopting Zero Trust often requires new skills in cloud security, identity management, and network analytics. Many security teams are under-resourced. In the financial sector, **69% of firms reported staff shortages and limited expertise as major barriers to achieving full visibility** ([The Secret to Reducing Compliance Risk in Financial Services: Visibility  Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/blog/security/secret-to-reducing-compliance-risk-financial-services-visibility#:~:text=Many%20institutions%20operate%20with%20disparate,tooling%20as%20a%20key%20factor)). Similarly, across industries, organizations struggle to train or hire staff who can manage advanced Zero Trust monitoring tools and interpret the flood of telemetry. This skills gap can lead to misconfigured tools and missed alerts.

- **Siloed Teams and Processes:** Gaining enterprise-wide visibility under Zero Trust requires breaking down silos between IT, security, network, and application teams. However, legacy organizational structures often segregate these duties. Government guidance for Zero Trust notes that success _“requires engagement and cooperation from senior leadership, IT staff, data and system owners, and users”_ across the organization ([Zero Trust Maturity Model Version 2.0](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/CISA_Zero_Trust_Maturity_Model_Version_2_508c.pdf#:~:text=solutions%20and%20continued%20discussions%20on,and%20staff%20to%20coordinated%20and)). Many organizations must **transition from stove-piped, siloed IT services to a coordinated Zero Trust strategy** with common architecture and governance ([Zero Trust Maturity Model Version 2.0](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/CISA_Zero_Trust_Maturity_Model_Version_2_508c.pdf#:~:text=owners%2C%20and%20users%20across%20the,This)). Until teams share tools and data, visibility will remain fragmented (for instance, cloud ops might see cloud logs, network teams see network flows, but no one has end-to-end insight).

- **Lack of Governance and Asset Ownership:** Implementing Zero Trust visibility is not just a technical project—it demands strong governance to define policies and ownership. A **lack of clear governance** can hinder visibility initiatives. In healthcare, one of the top Zero Trust hurdles is having _no formal process to discover and track all devices_, leading to visibility blind spots ([Overcoming the Challenges of Clinical Zero Trust  Claroty](https://claroty.com/blog/overcoming-the-challenges-of-clinical-zero-trust#:~:text=healthcare%20more%20broadly%2C%20is%20blindspots,controls%20to%20fully%20protect%20and)). If no team is accountable for maintaining a unified asset inventory or monitoring program, important security data will fall through the cracks. Effective governance would ensure every application, device, and user is accounted for and being monitored appropriately.

- **Top-Down Pressure and Cultural Resistance:** Paradoxically, leaders’ urgency for Zero Trust can be a challenge if not matched with resources and cultural change. Over 200 CISOs in 2024 cited _“pressure from the board to achieve Zero Trust” as the number-one concern_ ([Hybrid Cloud Security Trends 2024  Gigamon](https://www.gigamon.com/campaigns/hybrid-cloud-security-survey.html#:~:text=CISOs%20are%20under%20pressure%20Pressure,ranked%20the%20number%201%20concern)). This pressure can result in rushed implementations or simply checking compliance boxes rather than truly improving visibility. On the flip side, front-line staff and middle management might resist changes that Zero Trust brings (like new authentication steps or network restrictions), potentially circumventing controls and creating shadow IT. Organizational buy-in at all levels is needed so that security monitoring is seen as everyone’s responsibility, not an impediment to productivity. Building a culture of security awareness and cooperation is an ongoing challenge for Zero Trust programs.

- **Resource Constraints:** Lastly, organizations often underestimate the resources (time, budget, and personnel) required to instrument a Zero Trust environment for full visibility. There is _“no easy button”_ for automating all the monitoring and reporting that Zero Trust demands ([Federal agencies face zero-trust cybersecurity crunch as OMB deadline looms  FedScoop](https://fedscoop.com/federal-agencies-face-zero-trust-cybersecurity-crunch-as-omb-deadline-looms/#:~:text=No%20%E2%80%98Easy%20Button%E2%80%99)). For example, federal agencies reported limited time and inefficient existing tools, with _“not enough time, … inefficient [tools], and … limited resources to solve the problems”_ of Zero Trust visibility ([Federal agencies face zero-trust cybersecurity crunch as OMB deadline looms  FedScoop](https://fedscoop.com/federal-agencies-face-zero-trust-cybersecurity-crunch-as-omb-deadline-looms/#:~:text=monitor%20devices%20operating%20in%20incongruent,technology%20ecosystems)). Private companies face similar constraints when justifying budget for extensive monitoring capabilities. Without sufficient investment in tools and people, visibility will lag behind the threats.

## Strategic Challenges and Gaps

At a strategic level, security and risk leaders must align Zero Trust visibility efforts with business goals, compliance requirements, and long-term plans. Some high-level challenges include:

- **Integrating Legacy Systems:** Many industries rely on legacy systems and applications that were not built with Zero Trust in mind. These systems often **assume “implicit trust”** (e.g. internal users are automatically trusted) which _conflicts with the core Zero Trust principle of continuous verification_ ([Zero Trust Maturity Model Version 2.0](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/CISA_Zero_Trust_Maturity_Model_Version_2_508c.pdf#:~:text=The%20Federal%20Government%2C%20as%20with,Furthermore%2C%20as%20the%20technology%20landscape)). Adapting or replacing legacy infrastructure is expensive and time-consuming, creating a strategic dilemma. The U.S. federal government, like most large enterprises, notes that legacy systems will _“require investment to change [and] align with zero trust principles”_ ([Zero Trust Maturity Model Version 2.0](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/CISA_Zero_Trust_Maturity_Model_Version_2_508c.pdf#:~:text=Legacy%20systems%20often%20rely%20on,landscape%20continues%20to%20evolve%2C%20new)). This technical debt is a top hurdle: in one 2024 survey, **54% of organizations cited accumulated IAM technical debt as the biggest obstacle to modernizing their identity and access architecture** ([According to Cloud Security Alliance Survey More than Half of  CSA](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/press-releases/2024/10/30/csa-finds-technical-debt-as-top-hurdle-to-identity-system-modernization#:~:text=The%20survey%2C%20which%20sought%20to,when%20modernizing%20their%20IAM%20architecture)). Until legacy systems are modernized or wrapped with new security layers, they can remain visibility “black holes” in a Zero Trust design.

- **Defining Metrics and Measuring Success:** Zero Trust is a journey, and leaders struggle to measure progress and effectiveness. Unlike perimeter security, where one could track fewer incidents at the firewall, Zero Trust success is more nuanced (e.g. detecting incidents faster, limiting lateral movement, etc.). Many organizations lack clear metrics for visibility and risk reduction. For instance, how do you quantify “trust” or the absence of an undetected threat? Strategic plans often call for improved visibility, yet **over 73% of organizations believe better visibility is essential for risk management, and more than one-third still feel unsure about monitoring critical identity and access areas** ([According to Cloud Security Alliance Survey More than Half of  CSA](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/press-releases/2024/10/30/csa-finds-technical-debt-as-top-hurdle-to-identity-system-modernization#:~:text=%2A%20Visibility%20gaps%20in%20multi,maintaining%20or%20increasing%20their%20identity)). This indicates a gap between strategic goals and confidence in execution. Leaders need to establish visibility KPIs (like mean time to detect/respond, coverage of asset logging, percentage of encrypted traffic inspected, etc.) to drive their Zero Trust initiatives, but formulating these metrics is challenging.

- **Balancing Security with Business Operations:** A Zero Trust strategy must ensure security without paralyzing the business. This is especially true in sectors like healthcare (where patient care cannot be interrupted) and finance (which requires uptime and quick customer service). Strategically, CISOs must choose controls that provide visibility but also maintain performance and user experience. In healthcare, for example, **cybersecurity must not disrupt clinical workflows**—medical devices and applications need to be available for patient care at all times ([Overcoming the Challenges of Clinical Zero Trust  Claroty](https://claroty.com/blog/overcoming-the-challenges-of-clinical-zero-trust#:~:text=As%20healthcare%20systems%20look%20to,and%20the%20strategy%20behind%20it)). This means security leaders sometimes have to compromise or phase in controls, possibly leaving temporary visibility gaps. Crafting a Zero Trust roadmap that prioritizes high-risk areas first while slowly expanding monitoring to all systems is a delicate task. It requires cross-department planning so that networking, IT, and business units all support the changes.

- **Interoperability and Vendor Management:** Strategically, many organizations aim to avoid getting locked into a single vendor for all Zero Trust components, but using best-of-breed solutions can create integration challenges. **Multi-vendor environments** demand open standards and APIs for telemetry; if not, security data gets siloed. A Cloud Security Alliance report found that while using multiple identity or cloud providers can offer flexibility, it _“also adds complexity to managing access controls across disparate systems,”_ a concern cited by 65% of respondents ([According to Cloud Security Alliance Survey More than Half of  CSA](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/press-releases/2024/10/30/csa-finds-technical-debt-as-top-hurdle-to-identity-system-modernization#:~:text=%2A%20The%20double,their%20ability%20to%20monitor%20and)). Leaders must push for interoperability between tools (identity, endpoint, SIEM, cloud monitoring, etc.) as part of their strategy. They also need to ensure new solutions can plug into an enterprise data pipeline or “single pane of glass.” Without this strategic focus, organizations end up with islands of visibility. Additionally, **third-party partners and suppliers** pose a visibility challenge—if an organization adopts Zero Trust but its partners have weak controls, monitoring external access (and enforcing Zero Trust principles on shared data) becomes difficult. For example, nearly half of hospitals use numerous third-party remote access tools but _“lack a clear view into remote connections”_ by those vendors ([Overcoming the Challenges of Clinical Zero Trust  Claroty](https://claroty.com/blog/overcoming-the-challenges-of-clinical-zero-trust#:~:text=tasks%2C%20having%20visibility%20into%20what,way%20to%20Clinical%20Zero%20Trust)). This kind of gap is a strategic issue: it requires broader solutions like requiring partners to meet certain Zero Trust criteria or using federated monitoring solutions.

- **Compliance and Regulatory Pressure:** Aligning Zero Trust visibility with compliance requirements is another strategic challenge. Many industries must adhere to strict regulations on data protection and incident reporting. Zero Trust can help meet these by providing detailed audit logs and strict access controls, but only if implemented thoroughly. In practice, **visibility shortfalls have already caused compliance issues** – in financial services, more than _60% of organizations incurred costs due to non-compliance_ in part because they lacked a full view of their infrastructure and user activity ([The Secret to Reducing Compliance Risk in Financial Services: Visibility  Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/blog/security/secret-to-reducing-compliance-risk-financial-services-visibility#:~:text=More%20than%2060,%E2%80%94%20a%20costly%20blind%20spot)). Similarly, government agencies have mandates (e.g. from OMB) to be able to produce detailed asset and incident reports quickly. OMB Memorandum M-24-04 requires federal agencies to have tools that provide a _“comprehensive understanding of all devices”_ on the network and to report that information (to CISA) within 72 hours of request ([Federal agencies face zero-trust cybersecurity crunch as OMB deadline looms  FedScoop](https://fedscoop.com/federal-agencies-face-zero-trust-cybersecurity-crunch-as-omb-deadline-looms/#:~:text=To%20address%20those%20and%20related,CISA%29%20within%2072%20hours)). Strategically, CISOs need to ensure their visibility capabilities meet such requirements. Failing to do so not only increases security risk but can result in legal penalties or loss of customer trust. The challenge is that regulations often outpace an organization’s tooling—meeting these obligations might require accelerated investment and executive support.

In summary, the strategic landscape requires leaders to invest in modernizing infrastructure, define clear objectives for visibility, insist on integration, and constantly balance security with business needs. No single solution or “silver bullet” exists; instead, a sustained multi-year effort is needed to close visibility gaps and mature a Zero Trust program.

## Industry-Specific Insights

While the above challenges are common across sectors, different industries experience Zero Trust visibility issues in unique ways. Below we provide insights and data for **finance, healthcare, and government**. (If certain statistical or case study data is unavailable, we note it explicitly.)

### Financial Services Industry

Financial institutions have been early adopters of Zero Trust concepts due to high stakes: they face stringent regulations, sophisticated cybercriminals, and insider fraud. One big challenge is achieving **unified visibility for compliance and threat detection** across sprawling IT environments. According to a 2024 study, **52% of financial services firms lack visibility across all their users, assets, and infrastructure**, leaving critical blind spots ([The Secret to Reducing Compliance Risk in Financial Services: Visibility  Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/blog/security/secret-to-reducing-compliance-risk-financial-services-visibility#:~:text=in%20financial%20services)). These blind spots are not just theoretical – nearly **9 in 10 financial institutions experienced a major operational incident in the prior 18 months** that was often attributed to visibility gaps in their systems ([The Secret to Reducing Compliance Risk in Financial Services: Visibility  Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/blog/security/secret-to-reducing-compliance-risk-financial-services-visibility#:~:text=According%20to%20a%202024%20study%2C,trust%20and%20ensure%20regulatory%20compliance)). Such incidents (e.g. undetected data exfiltration or system outages) underscore an urgent need for comprehensive, real-time monitoring in banking and finance.

Financial organizations also struggle with **complex, fragmented environments**. Large banks might run legacy core banking systems, numerous SaaS applications, public cloud services, and thousands of employee endpoints. Data and transactions flow across many platforms, making end-to-end tracking difficult. Many firms report that **fragmented tools and silos lead to inconsistent oversight** – for instance, different teams monitoring ATM networks vs. trading systems. It’s no surprise that **61% of financial firms cite fragmented tooling as a key barrier to full visibility** ([The Secret to Reducing Compliance Risk in Financial Services: Visibility  Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/blog/security/secret-to-reducing-compliance-risk-financial-services-visibility#:~:text=Many%20institutions%20operate%20with%20disparate,tooling%20as%20a%20key%20factor)). In addition, talent shortages hit this industry hard: that same survey found **staff limitations (69% of firms) hinder efforts to monitor and secure everything** ([The Secret to Reducing Compliance Risk in Financial Services: Visibility  Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/blog/security/secret-to-reducing-compliance-risk-financial-services-visibility#:~:text=Many%20institutions%20operate%20with%20disparate,tooling%20as%20a%20key%20factor)). In practice, banks may have state-of-the-art security in one domain (like an anti-fraud system for online banking) but lack visibility in another (like internal employee access or third-party vendors), because they simply don’t have enough skilled personnel to deploy and manage a unified solution.

**Insider threats** further complicate visibility for finance. With thousands of employees and contractors, and high-value data, financial firms worry about malicious or careless insiders. Over _70% of financial services firms are considered at risk of insider threats_, and an average insider incident costs $16 million ( [Zero Trust: Redefining Security in Banking & Financial Services  Ping Identity](https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/post/zero-trust-financial-services.html#:~:text=1.%20Over%2070,Zero%20Trust%20is%20the%20shield)). Zero Trust principles (never trust, always verify) are meant to address this by monitoring user behavior continuously. However, implementing such monitoring without overwhelming analysts is difficult. Many banks are turning to user behavior analytics and identity-centric Zero Trust, but integrating these with network monitoring is an ongoing effort. It’s notable that **lateral movement is a major focus** now—firms recognize that once an insider or attacker gains a foothold, the next step is often moving silently through internal systems. As one expert noted, _“Zero Trust is perimeter-less and only once CISOs prioritize lateral traffic monitoring can they truly [be confident]…”_ ([Hybrid Cloud Security Trends 2024  Gigamon](https://www.gigamon.com/campaigns/hybrid-cloud-security-survey.html#:~:text=Threat%20actors%20are%20successfully%20hiding,West%20traffic)) ([Hybrid Cloud Security Trends 2024  Gigamon](https://www.gigamon.com/campaigns/hybrid-cloud-security-survey.html#:~:text=CISOs%20are%20alerted%20too%20late,being%20able%20to%20access%20applications)). In practice, this means investing in tools that can inspect East–West traffic within data centers and cloud environments for anomalies, an area where visibility is often lacking.

From a **regulatory standpoint**, finance has little room for error. Regulators worldwide now expect robust audit logs, rapid breach detection, and proof of control over data access. Financial firms that cannot centrally report who accessed what data (and when) risk fines. Indeed, more than **60% of financial organizations have incurred compliance costs due to poor visibility and unchecked areas of their network** ([The Secret to Reducing Compliance Risk in Financial Services: Visibility  Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/blog/security/secret-to-reducing-compliance-risk-financial-services-visibility#:~:text=More%20than%2060,%E2%80%94%20a%20costly%20blind%20spot)). The industry is responding by prioritizing visibility in their budgets: in one survey, over half of financial institutions said they are increasing investment in “identity analytics and visibility” tools in 2025 ([According to Cloud Security Alliance Survey More than Half of  CSA](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/press-releases/2024/10/30/csa-finds-technical-debt-as-top-hurdle-to-identity-system-modernization#:~:text=how%20access%20policies%20are%20applied,43)). **Case studies** of banks adopting Zero Trust often highlight the need to unify data from many security tools. For example, a large bank might implement a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to ingest logs from identity systems, cloud platforms, and on-premises servers, then layer behavior analytics on top. Such projects are complex and require executive support. (Specific case study data for individual banks is often kept internal for security reasons, so public statistics beyond surveys are limited in this domain.)

In summary, the financial services industry recognizes visibility as a linchpin of Zero Trust — both to stop advanced threats and to meet regulatory demands. Significant challenges remain in breaking down silos between systems and teams. However, recent trends (like consolidating tools and focusing on real-time monitoring of internal traffic) show that finance is actively tackling these visibility gaps, backed by budget increases and board-level attention.

### Healthcare Industry

Healthcare organizations (hospitals, clinics, pharma companies) face a unique blend of Zero Trust visibility challenges driven by their mix of IT and life-critical systems. A standout issue is the prevalence of **legacy and unmanaged devices**. Medical devices such as MRI machines, IV pumps, and patient monitors are often running outdated software or are managed by external vendors, making it hard for hospital IT to monitor them. One cybersecurity study notes that _blind spots in hospital networks often arise simply because IT teams “don’t know every device connected”_ to the environment ([Overcoming the Challenges of Clinical Zero Trust  Claroty](https://claroty.com/blog/overcoming-the-challenges-of-clinical-zero-trust#:~:text=healthcare%20more%20broadly%2C%20is%20blindspots,controls%20to%20fully%20protect%20and)). An accurate, real-time inventory is foundational to Zero Trust, yet many healthcare providers lack this. For example, biometric devices and medical IoT might not report into standard asset management systems. The **governance challenge** (who is responsible for securing and monitoring each device) is pronounced: Clinical engineering departments might manage medical equipment, while IT handles computers – a silo that Zero Trust strategies must bridge.

**Insider risk and user monitoring** are also critical in healthcare. Notably, healthcare is the one industry where **insiders pose the greatest threat**: _58% of healthcare security incidents involve internal actors_, whether due to error, snooping, or malicious intent ([[PDF] Protected Health Information Data Breach Report - Verizon](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/protected_health_information_data_breach_report.pdf#:~:text=,%E2%80%A2%20Medical%20device%20hacking)). This statistic (from a Verizon data breach report) highlights why Zero Trust visibility is so important in healthcare – staff like nurses, doctors, or billing clerks already inside the network can be a source of breaches if their access is misused. Continuous monitoring of user activity (especially access to patient records or prescription systems) is needed to catch inappropriate access early. However, implementing this faces cultural and privacy hurdles. Care providers are concerned about productivity and patient privacy, so security teams must carefully balance monitoring with trust in staff. Some hospitals use analytics to detect anomalous behavior (e.g. an employee suddenly accessing far more patient records than usual), but these systems must be fine-tuned to avoid false positives that could impede healthcare delivery.

Another challenge is **interoperability and third-party access**. Hospitals often use multiple vendors for remote support of medical devices or for consulting services. According to a 2024 survey, **44% of hospitals have six or more different secure access solutions for third-parties, yet still lack a clear view of all remote connections into their network** ([Overcoming the Challenges of Clinical Zero Trust  Claroty](https://claroty.com/blog/overcoming-the-challenges-of-clinical-zero-trust#:~:text=tasks%2C%20having%20visibility%20into%20what,way%20to%20Clinical%20Zero%20Trust)). This indicates a patchwork approach to vendor access: one vendor might use a VPN, another a remote desktop tool, etc. The result is that security teams cannot easily monitor what external technicians are doing on clinical systems. Zero Trust aims to enforce least privilege and session monitoring for _every_ user, including external ones, but integrating these various access methods into a single monitoring dashboard is difficult. Some healthcare organizations are moving to standardized vendor access platforms (with recording and auditing), but not all have done so.

**Visibility into network traffic and segmentation** is also a healthcare concern. Traditionally, hospital networks were flat or only lightly segmented, which means an infected device could communicate freely across the hospital. Zero Trust pushes for micro-segmentation — for example, lab devices should only talk to lab systems, not the entire network. To implement and verify this, hospitals need granular visibility into network communications. Challenge #2 of “Clinical Zero Trust” (as one industry report dubs it) is having a _“limited understanding of device communications”_ – knowing not just what devices exist, but **how they normally communicate, how often, and with which systems**, in order to spot abnormal patterns ([Overcoming the Challenges of Clinical Zero Trust  Claroty](https://claroty.com/blog/overcoming-the-challenges-of-clinical-zero-trust#:~:text=Challenge%20,device%20visibility%20and%20communications)). Many healthcare providers lack this baseline knowledge. Network visibility tools (like traffic analysis appliances or deep packet inspection) may not be deployed widely in clinical networks due to cost or complexity. This gap means malicious activity could go undetected for longer. Indeed, the rise in healthcare cyberattacks is alarming: the U.S. health sector saw a **278% increase in large ransomware breaches from 2018 to 2022** according to HHS data ([Federal agencies face zero-trust cybersecurity crunch as OMB deadline looms  FedScoop](https://fedscoop.com/federal-agencies-face-zero-trust-cybersecurity-crunch-as-omb-deadline-looms/#:~:text=The%20healthcare%20sector%20has%20also,even%20put%20lives%20at%20risk)). In several incidents, attackers had quietly obtained credentials or device access and lurked before launching disruptive attacks — underscoring that initial _lack of visibility_ to detect the intrusions early.

It’s worth noting that the **healthcare industry has relatively less public statistical data on Zero Trust implementation progress** compared to finance or government. Hospitals and healthcare systems are cautious about sharing security specifics. However, anecdotal evidence and expert opinions indicate that many healthcare providers are still in early stages of Zero Trust adoption. They often start with identity-centric controls (like multi-factor authentication and stricter access governance) and are gradually improving network visibility through solutions tailored to medical environments. For instance, some hospitals have adopted network monitoring tools that are aware of medical device protocols and can flag unusual behavior without touching the device (important because you can’t install typical security agents on an MRI machine). Case studies from late 2023 show health systems piloting “clinical Zero Trust” platforms that passively discover devices and segment them. The results are promising in finding previously unknown devices and connections. Yet, challenges remain in scaling these solutions system-wide and ensuring that security measures do not disrupt patient care.

In conclusion, healthcare faces a tough balancing act: **securing highly sensitive data and systems in a Zero Trust model while preserving the continuity of care**. Visibility is at the heart of this challenge. Progress is being made via better asset discovery and network analytics tools designed for healthcare, but many organizations have a long way to go. The high percentage of insider-related breaches and the explosion of connected medical devices make it clear that without comprehensive visibility, hospitals will remain vulnerable. We can expect to see continued investments in this sector on building centralized monitoring for both IT and clinical technology, although concrete industry-wide metrics on Zero Trust adoption in healthcare are not widely published as of 2025.

### Government (Public Sector)

Government agencies, especially at the federal level, have been mandated to adopt Zero Trust architectures in recent years. This top-down push (e.g. U.S. Executive Order 14028 and OMB mandates) has driven agencies to develop Zero Trust strategies, but **visibility into these complex environments is one of the hardest challenges**. A primary issue is the **prevalence of legacy systems and networks** in government. Many agencies still run decades-old systems alongside modern cloud services. As noted in the CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model (2023), the federal government _“faces several challenges in implementing ZTA”_ and **legacy systems built on implicit trust are a major obstacle** ([Zero Trust Maturity Model Version 2.0](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/CISA_Zero_Trust_Maturity_Model_Version_2_508c.pdf#:~:text=The%20Federal%20Government%2C%20as%20with,Furthermore%2C%20as%20the%20technology%20landscape)). These old systems often lack telemetry or are not compatible with modern logging and analytics tools, creating blind spots. An agency cannot fully monitor what it cannot instrument; yet replacing these systems is slow. This means that, in the near term, agencies must find creative ways (such as proxies or network sensors) to gain visibility into legacy environments until they can be modernized.

Another challenge in government is the sheer **scope of assets and data types**. Agencies must monitor traditional IT (servers, workstations, databases) _and_ a growing array of OT/IoT devices used in facilities, infrastructure control, and even defense systems. A recent FedScoop report highlighted that _inventorying and monitoring the ever-expanding mix of IT, OT, and IoT assets_ is a **“vexing requirement”** for agencies striving for Zero Trust ([Federal agencies face zero-trust cybersecurity crunch as OMB deadline looms  FedScoop](https://fedscoop.com/federal-agencies-face-zero-trust-cybersecurity-crunch-as-omb-deadline-looms/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20more%20vexing,The%20convergence%20of%20data%20and)). For example, a federal energy lab might have to monitor office IT networks and specialized industrial control systems for the power grid. Merging visibility of these under one strategy is difficult. Data from OT systems may not feed into standard SIEMs, and the security teams for OT and IT historically have been separate. However, cyber threats now exploit any gap between these areas. The _convergence of IT and OT_ means a breach in one can affect the other ([Federal agencies face zero-trust cybersecurity crunch as OMB deadline looms  FedScoop](https://fedscoop.com/federal-agencies-face-zero-trust-cybersecurity-crunch-as-omb-deadline-looms/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20more%20vexing,has%20tasked%20agencies%20to%20address)), so Zero Trust strategies in government are placing new emphasis on unified visibility across all systems. Some agencies are deploying enterprise asset management tools and network monitoring that covers both IT and OT networks, but maturity varies widely.

**Resource and staffing constraints** in the public sector also impede visibility efforts. Government CISOs have to work with fixed budgets and often cannot pay salaries competitive with the private sector for top talent. As one federal cybersecurity director observed, agencies often _“don’t have enough time, [existing] tools are inefficient, and [have] limited resources to solve”_ the visibility challenges ([Federal agencies face zero-trust cybersecurity crunch as OMB deadline looms  FedScoop](https://fedscoop.com/federal-agencies-face-zero-trust-cybersecurity-crunch-as-omb-deadline-looms/#:~:text=monitor%20devices%20operating%20in%20incongruent,technology%20ecosystems)). This can result in agencies relying on a patchwork of older security tools that don’t integrate well. There is an ongoing effort, supported by CISA and federal funding, to provide agencies with centralized dashboards and shared services for certain aspects of Zero Trust (for instance, some agencies use CISA’s Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation [CDM] program tools for asset management and vulnerability scanning). Still, **capability gaps remain**, and not all agencies are at the same level. (Precise statistics on how many agencies have achieved full visibility are not publicly available; internal scorecards exist but are not released due to security sensitivities. What is known is that as the 2024 OMB deadline approached, many agencies were still working on foundational steps like reliable asset inventories and log management.)

The **strategic coordination** required in government is itself a challenge. Unlike a private company, a federal department might contain dozens of bureaus with their own IT systems. Ensuring a _“common architecture and governance policies”_ for Zero Trust across an entire department is difficult ([Zero Trust Maturity Model Version 2.0](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/CISA_Zero_Trust_Maturity_Model_Version_2_508c.pdf#:~:text=owners%2C%20and%20users%20across%20the,This)). Some agencies have created Zero Trust task forces or working groups to standardize approaches, but others struggle with inter-office coordination. This can lead to uneven visibility—one sub-agency might have robust monitoring, while another has blind spots, creating overall risk. Additionally, government agencies must abide by strict privacy and civil liberty rules when monitoring users, especially in law enforcement or intelligence contexts. They have to draw clear lines between security visibility and improper surveillance, which adds complexity to how monitoring tools are deployed and what data can be collected.

On a positive note, government mandates have forced a focus on visibility outcomes. Agencies are required not just to implement tools, but to be able to detect and respond to incidents effectively. For example, OMB’s zero trust strategy requires agencies to _“achieve centralized access to logs and visibility”_ across multiple domains (identity, devices, network, etc.) and to use automation for analytics where possible. While not all agencies met every goal by the FY 2024 deadline, there is now momentum and funding to continue improvements. The public sector also collaborates on challenges like this; best practices are being shared via the Federal CISO Council and in published guidance (CISA’s maturity model explicitly highlights **Visibility and Analytics** as one of three cross-cutting capabilities under Zero Trust ([Zero Trust Maturity Model Version 2.0](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/CISA_Zero_Trust_Maturity_Model_Version_2_508c.pdf#:~:text=advancements%20can%20be%20made%20over,States%20Digital%20Services%E2%80%99%2C%20and%20FedRAMP%E2%80%99s))). This means visibility is recognized as fundamental, not an afterthought.

In summary, the government sector’s challenges in gaining Zero Trust visibility revolve around **outdated technology, massive scale, and coordination across diverse entities**. Concrete statistical data on progress is limited publicly (and likely classified in parts), but numerous reports and official statements confirm these pain points. The strategy moving forward is clear: invest in modernizing systems, unify dashboards for enterprise-wide insight, and ensure every new system or cloud service an agency adopts has the hooks for centralized monitoring. Agencies that have embraced these steps are seeing improvements, whereas those that lag will remain at higher risk. The coming years (2025 and beyond) will likely bring more transparency about federal Zero Trust progress, as oversight bodies and Congress push for evidence that agencies can actually _see_ and secure what’s happening in their environments.

## Conclusion

Across all industries, one theme is evident: **visibility is the foundation of Zero Trust, yet achieving it is easier said than done.** Technical hurdles like encrypted traffic, multi-cloud complexity, and tool integration issues create blind spots. Organizational issues such as skill shortages, silos, and inadequate governance impede progress. Strategically, legacy baggage and the need to align Zero Trust with business objectives complicate the journey. The finance, healthcare, and government sectors illustrate these challenges in different ways – from banks juggling compliance and insider threats, to hospitals grappling with device management, to agencies contending with legacy systems and mandates. What they share is the imperative to close visibility gaps in order to make Zero Trust effective.

Recent expert opinions and surveys (2023–2025) reinforce that fact-based approach: leaders are investing in deep observability, consolidating tools, and seeking real-time insights. For instance, **84% of organizations agree that deep observability (comprehensive visibility) is fundamental to strengthening cloud security** ([Hybrid Cloud Security Trends 2024  Gigamon](https://www.gigamon.com/campaigns/hybrid-cloud-security-survey.html#:~:text=encrypted%20traffic%20as%20a%20top,priority)), and **80% have made Zero Trust a key priority for the next 18 months** ([Hybrid Cloud Security Trends 2024  Gigamon](https://www.gigamon.com/campaigns/hybrid-cloud-security-survey.html#:~:text=Zero%20Trust%20continues%20to%20gain,momentum)). These figures show momentum. Yet, the same research found over **75% of security leaders believe internal traffic visibility is even more important now than perimeter monitoring** ([Hybrid Cloud Security Trends 2024  Gigamon](https://www.gigamon.com/campaigns/hybrid-cloud-security-survey.html#:~:text=Image%3A%20icon)), reflecting how priorities have shifted.

In closing, CISOs and security leaders should approach Zero Trust not as a one-off project but as an evolving program that addresses visibility at every layer: device, user, network, application, and data. Success stories often involve incremental improvements—starting with gaining visibility into the most critical assets and expanding outward. By understanding the challenges outlined above and learning from cross-industry insights, organizations can better plan their Zero Trust roadmaps. The path is difficult, but with a combination of the right tools, skilled people, and executive support, the visibility gaps can be systematically closed, enabling the true potential of Zero Trust to be realized in a measurable, resilient security posture.
