## Mission

To provide resilient IT, cybersecurity and infrastructure services.

## How we achieve success

### Four design principles

- Identify the stakeholders and document the business objectives.
- Determine who and what needs access to critical resources.
- Work from the inside out, starting with securing critical resources to make them resilient.
- Inspect and log all traffic using risk-based assessments of critical resources.

### Five-step methodology

1. Define manageable Protect Surfaces around applications and workloads by segmenting the larger attack surface.
2. Using multi-agent RAG, we analyze and map all transaction flows for observability, logging, SIEM, and SOAR.
3. Create access policies for continuous identity verification.
4. Develop security solutions to match the organization's service value system.
5. Monitor security posture strength and resiliency through feedback loops and continuous improvement projects.
