## Scenario Background

The Earth Federation Space Force's Cyber Defense Division provides network monitoring and intrusion response services to over 50 space colonies and Federation bases across the Earth Sphere. Among their prime allies are:

- Side 1 Financial Authority (banking and cryptocurrency)
- Side 4 Medical Research (healthcare and biotech)
- Luna II Command (military infrastructure)
- Von Braun City (advanced technology development)

The Federation utilizes a state-of-the-art Newtype Detection Center (NDC) that aggregates data streams and alerts from allied environments, with a centralized holographic interface for monitoring and response.

## Exercise Narrative

A specialized unit of Zeon infiltration specialists known as "Char's Phantoms" has identified the Federation's Cyber Defense Division as the perfect target for a military infiltration operation. Their objective is to compromise the Federation's infrastructure to gain access to high-value colony systems and military installations. The attack will unfold in multiple stages over the course of the exercise, combining both cyber warfare and psychological operations tactics.
