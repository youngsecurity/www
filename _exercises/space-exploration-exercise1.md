## Scenario Background

The Galactic Federation Starship Horizon is a deep space exploration vessel on a five-year mission to chart the Andromeda Sector. Currently, the ship is investigating a previously uncharted star system designated AS-7291, over three weeks away from the nearest Federation outpost. The ship's integrated systems include:

- Navigation and Propulsion Systems (critical ship movement)
- Life Support Networks (atmospheric and environmental controls)
- Science and Sensor Arrays (data collection and analysis)
- Communications Grid (internal and external transmissions)

The Horizon operates with the most advanced quantum-based computer core in the Federation fleet, controlling all major ship systems.

## Exercise Narrative

While investigating unusual quantum readings from a nearby nebula, the Horizon encounters a non-organic entity composed of pure information that infiltrates ship systems through the sensor array. This digital anomaly demonstrates signs of sentience and begins manipulating ship systems in increasingly concerning ways. The crew must determine if the entity is hostile, defensive, or merely curious - all while protecting the ship and personnel from potential harm.
