## Scenario Background

The Kingdom of Highkeep maintains a sophisticated network of defensive enchantments and wards surrounding the royal castle and its treasures. The Royal Wizard Corps provides monitoring and protection for:

- Castle Perimeter Wards (outer defense system)

- Enemy Detection Mirrors (threat identification network)

The kingdom utilizes an advanced Magical Operations Center that monitors all defensive enchantments, with specialized wizards providing real-time analysis and coordination of magical defenses.

## Exercise Narrative

The neighboring Kingdom of Shadowfen has dispatched their elite Dragon Knights to infiltrate Highkeep Castle. Their objective is to breach the magical defenses to steal sensitive information about the kingdom's military capabilities and diplomatic strategies. The attack will unfold in multiple stages over the course of the exercise, combining both magical infiltration and traditional espionage.
