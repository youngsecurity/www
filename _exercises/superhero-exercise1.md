## Scenario Background

The Justice League operates the Watchtower, an advanced orbital headquarters that coordinates superhero response to global threats. The League's Cyber Defense Division provides monitoring and protection for:

- Watchtower Command Systems (orbital headquarters)
- Hall of Justice Network (Earth-based operations)
- Teleportation Grid (hero rapid deployment system)
- Crisis Alert System (global emergency monitoring)

The League utilizes a sophisticated Threat Monitoring Center that processes data from worldwide sensors, with Oracle and Cyborg providing real-time analysis and coordination of digital defenses.

## Exercise Narrative

A newly formed coalition of tech-based supervillains calling themselves "The Dark Circuit" has identified the Justice League's digital infrastructure as their primary target. Led by a mysterious mastermind, the group includes known enemies such as Brainiac, Calculator, and Professor Ivo. Their objective is to compromise League systems to disable hero response capabilities, allowing synchronized attacks on major cities. The cyber assault will unfold in multiple stages over the course of the exercise, combining advanced technology with metahuman abilities.
