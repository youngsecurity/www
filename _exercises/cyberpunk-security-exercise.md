## Scenario Background

NeuralGuard Industries is a cutting-edge security corporation providing network monitoring and
intrusion response services to over 50 megacorporations across Night City and beyond. Among their
prime clients are:

- ArasaCorp Financial (banking and cryptocurrency)
- MediTech Systems (cybernetic implants and healthcare)
- Petrochem Grid (energy infrastructure)
- Netronics Enterprises (digital infrastructure and AI)

NeuralGuard utilizes a state-of-the-art Neural Operations Center (NOC) that aggregates datastreams
and alerts from client environments, with a centralized holographic interface for monitoring and
response.

## Exercise Narrative

A notorious netrunning crew known as "Phantom Collective" has identified NeuralGuard as the perfect
target for a corporate infiltration job. Their objective is to compromise NeuralGuard's
infrastructure to gain access to high-value corporate clients. The attack will unfold in multiple
stages over the course of the exercise, combining both digital intrusion and social engineering
tactics.

## Exercise Timeline and Data Spikes

### Phase 1: Initial Breach (0:00-1:00)

#### Setting the Scene (0:00-0:10)

- Fixer introduces the scenario as a standard night shift at NeuralGuard NOC
- Teams are at their stations performing routine network monitoring

#### Data Spike 1 (0:10): Unauthorized Neural Link Detection

- A NOC alert shows an unusual successful authentication to the security platform from an
unregistered neural link
- The credentials belong to a junior netrunner who is currently on leave after a cybernetic upgrade
- The login occurred during the graveyard shift when security protocols are at minimal levels

*Expected Actions:*

- Investigate the neural alert
- Check netrunner's status via secure comms
- Review login source and trace the neural signature
- Begin documenting the incident in the corporate database

#### Data Spike 2 (0:30): Discovery of Suspicious Network Activity

- The compromised account has been spotted running unusual queries in the security platform
- Queries focused on gathering information about corporate connections, particularly for ArasaCorp
and Petrochem
- Several attempts to escalate user privileges were detected by passive ICE

*Expected Actions:*

- Escalate the incident to senior team members
- Consider isolating potentially affected subsystems
- Begin preparing initial corporate client communication if necessary
- Start assembling a rapid response team

#### Data Spike 3 (0:45): Data Siphon Detection

- An advanced ICE system identifies a potential data extraction daemon installed on an internal
system
- The daemon appears to have been injected using the compromised credentials
- Initial evidence suggests sensitive data about client network architectures may have been accessed

*Expected Actions:*

- Activate formal intrusion response procedures
- Assign roles and responsibilities to team members
- Begin deeper digital forensic investigation
- Consider whether to notify client corporations at this stage

### Phase 2: Escalation (1:00-2:00)

#### Data Spike 4 (1:00): Corporate Alert - ArasaCorp

- ArasaCorp security division calls reporting suspicious activities in their environment
- They've detected scanning routines coming from an IP address associated with NeuralGuard's
management infrastructure
- The scanning appears to be targeting their cryptocurrency transaction processing systems

*Expected Actions:*

- Acknowledge the potential connection to the earlier compromise
- Collaborate with the client's security team
- Investigate potential pivot from NeuralGuard systems to client network
- Update incident documentation and escalate internally

#### Data Spike 5 (1:20): Black ICE Detection

- Analysis of the compromised system reveals a sophisticated, previously unseen black ICE variant
- The malware provides persistent access and has anti-forensic routines
- Evidence shows the black ICE has been present for approximately 30 days, slowly mapping the
network

*Expected Actions:*

- Perform detailed code analysis
- Begin investigating patient zero and initial infection vector
- Consider implications for other systems and corporate clients
- Update incident response team and executive level

#### Data Spike 6 (1:40): Trace Elimination

- The intruders begin wiping logs and evidence from compromised systems
- Attempts to modify monitoring rules to avoid future detection are observed
- A corporate data-bomb is discovered but not yet detonated

*Expected Actions:*

- Take steps to preserve evidence before it's destroyed
- Implement additional monitoring to track intruder movements
- Consider system isolation measures
- Update risk assessment based on data-bomb discovery

### Phase 3: Crisis Management (2:00-3:00)

#### Data Spike 7 (2:00): Critical Infrastructure Alert

- Petrochem reports unusual connection attempts to their grid control systems
- The attempts are coming from trusted NeuralGuard monitoring servers
- Petrochem has severed NeuralGuard's access nodes as a precaution

*Expected Actions:*

- Acknowledge the severity of the situation
- Implement crisis communication procedures
- Coordinate with Petrochem's security division
- Prepare for potential regulatory reporting requirements and corporate fallout

#### Data Spike 8 (2:20): Executive Involvement

- NeuralGuard's CEO demands an immediate briefing on the situation
- Several other corporate clients have begun calling with concerns
- Media outlets and the NET have begun circulating rumors about a major security breach

*Expected Actions:*

- Prepare a concise executive summary
- Organize information for efficient decision-making
- Advise on potential corporate PR strategies
- Continue technical response activities

#### Data Spike 9 (2:40): Ransom Demand

- A holographic ransom message appears on several compromised systems
- The attackers claim to have exfiltrated client data and threaten to sell it on the black market
- They demand 2 million eurodollars in untraceable cryptocurrency within 48 hours

*Expected Actions:*

- Document the ransom demand
- Assess legitimacy of the attacker's claims
- Discuss potential response options with leadership
- Consider law enforcement notification

*Expected Actions:*

- Document all findings for post-incident analysis
- Develop a comprehensive remediation plan
- Prioritize critical security gaps for immediate patching
- Prepare technical details for affected corporate clients

#### Data Spike 11 (3:20): Containment Decision Point

- The incident response team must decide on final containment actions
- Options include temporary shutdown of the NOC platform vs. aggressive monitoring
- Each option has different impacts on service delivery, corporate reputation, and recovery time

*Expected Actions:*

- Evaluate pros and cons of each option
- Make a decision based on risk assessment
- Communicate the decision and rationale to stakeholders
- Begin implementing the chosen approach

#### Data Spike 12 (3:40): Recovery Planning
