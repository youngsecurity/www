## Scenario Background

S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division) operates a global security network that monitors threats and coordinates responses worldwide. The agency's Cybersecurity Division provides protection for:

- Helicarrier Command Systems (mobile headquarters)
- Global Operations Network (field bases and safe houses)
- Asset Tracking System (superhero and enhanced individual monitoring)
- Threat Response Grid (international incident coordination)

S.H.I.E.L.D. utilizes an advanced Threat Analysis Center that processes intelligence from worldwide sources, with specialized analysts providing real-time assessment and coordination of defensive measures.

## Exercise Narrative

HYDRA, the long-standing enemy of S.H.I.E.L.D., has deployed a specialized cyber operations team code-named "Chimera" to infiltrate the agency's networks. Led by former S.H.I.E.L.D. technicians with inside knowledge and enhanced by advanced technology, Chimera aims to compromise the Asset Tracking System to locate and target individual Avengers while simultaneously disrupting S.H.I.E.L.D.'s coordination capabilities. The attack will unfold in multiple stages over the course of the exercise, combining traditional hacking techniques with superhuman elements and advanced weaponry.
