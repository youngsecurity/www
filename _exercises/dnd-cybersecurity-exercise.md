## Campaign Background

The Guardian Order is a well-established Magical Security Provider offering arcane monitoring and threat response services to over 50 kingdoms across various realms. Among their key clients are:

- The Royal Bank of Goldkeep (treasury realm)
- The Healing Sanctum of Lifewell (healing realm)
- The Arcane Grid of Powerforge (elemental infrastructure)
- The Enchanted Towers of Technos (magical technology)

The Guardian Order uses a Scrying Operations Chamber that aggregates magical signatures and alerts from client kingdoms, with a centralized crystal ball for monitoring and response.

## Adventure Narrative

A sophisticated shadow mage has identified the Guardian Order as a prime target for a corruption attack. Their objective is to compromise the Order's magical infrastructure to gain access to high-value kingdoms. The attack will unfold in multiple stages over the course of the adventure.
