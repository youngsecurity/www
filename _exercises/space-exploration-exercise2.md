## Scenario Background

The Galactic Federation has revolutionized interstellar travel through the development of Quantum Starbridges - a network of entangled quantum gates that allow instantaneous travel between star systems. The Federation's Quantum Security Division provides monitoring and protection for:

- Alpha Centauri Primary Gateway (hub for Earth sector travel)
- Tau Ceti Trading Nexus (major commercial transport center)
- Arcturus Military Outpost (strategic defense installation)
- Sirius Scientific Collective (research and development center)

The Federation utilizes an advanced Quantum Operations Center that monitors the integrity and security of the entire starbridge network through quantum-entangled sensors, allowing for instantaneous awareness of any anomalies despite the vast distances involved.

## Exercise Narrative

A shadowy collective of quantum terrorists known as "Event Horizon" has identified vulnerabilities in the starbridge network. Their objective is to destabilize or collapse the quantum bridges, either to isolate star systems for conquest or to fulfill extremist beliefs that faster-than-light travel "tears the fabric of reality." The attack will unfold across multiple star systems simultaneously, exploiting the interconnected nature of quantum entanglement itself.
