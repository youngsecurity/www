## Scenario Background

Midnight Security Operations Center provides 24/7 security monitoring for a diverse client base, including several critical infrastructure providers. Intelligence reports have warned of a new threat actor group called "The Watchers" that combines sophisticated technical capabilities with psychological warfare techniques designed to destabilize security teams before launching their main attack.

## Exercise Narrative

The exercise simulates an escalating series of incidents where the adversary intentionally reveals their presence through disturbing imagery, personalized threats, and manipulation of digital systems in ways designed to create fear and uncertainty among the security team. The psychological elements mask a sophisticated attack against client infrastructure that must be detected despite the distractions.
