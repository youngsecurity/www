## Scenario Background

The Kingdom of Brightstone guards the eastern borders of the civilized realms, with Castle Brightstone serving as its formidable center of military power and governance. The castle's defenses include:

- Outer Bailey Fortifications (first line of physical defense)
- Inner Keep Defenses (secondary defensive position)
- Royal Vault Protection (securing critical assets)
- Kingdom Warning Network (intelligence gathering and alerts)

The kingdom uses a sophisticated defensive system combining military strength, magical wards, and an intelligence network of scouts and informants.

## Exercise Narrative

The neighboring Dark Empire has launched a campaign to seize control of Brightstone, using a combination of conventional forces, magical subversion, and infiltration. Their strategy involves weakening the castle from within before the main attack, using agents who have been in place for months. The exercise will test detection and response to this multi-faceted siege scenario.
