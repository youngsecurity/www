## Scenario Background

The Transcontinental Security Company provides telegraph monitoring and security services to over 50 banks, railroads, and towns across the frontier. Among their prime clients are:

- Wells & Fargo Banking Company (banking and gold shipments)
- Western Medical Supply (medicine and healthcare)
- Union Pacific Railroad (transportation infrastructure)
- Frontier Telegraph Company (communications network)

The Company utilizes a state-of-the-art Telegraph Monitoring Station that receives signals and alerts from client telegraph lines, with a central map table for tracking and response.

## Exercise Narrative

A notorious outlaw gang known as "The Black Hats" has identified the Transcontinental Security Company as the perfect target for a major heist. Their objective is to compromise the company's telegraph infrastructure to intercept information about gold shipments and train schedules. The attack will unfold in multiple stages over the course of the exercise, combining both telegraph manipulation and old-fashioned deception.
