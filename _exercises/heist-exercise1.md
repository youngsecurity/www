## Scenario Background

Diamondback Casino & Resort is a luxury gambling and entertainment destination catering to high-net-worth individuals. The casino's Security Division provides monitoring and protection for:

- Casino Management System (gaming floor operations)
- High-Roller Database (VIP guest information and preferences)
- Financial Transaction Network (cage operations and credit lines)
- Hotel Operations Grid (room access and guest services)

The casino utilizes a sophisticated Security Operations Center that monitors both physical and digital assets, with specialized teams focusing on fraud prevention, cyber threats, and physical security.

## Exercise Narrative

A notorious criminal crew known as "The Venetian Crew" has selected Diamondback as their next target. Led by a master strategist with a background in casino operations, the crew includes specialists in social engineering, digital intrusion, and financial fraud. Their objective is a two-pronged attack: compromising the casino's financial systems for a major theft while simultaneously harvesting high-roller data for future exploitation. The heist will unfold in multiple stages over the course of the exercise, combining technical attacks with social engineering and potential insider threats.

## Exercise Timeline and Scenarios
