## Scenario Background

Darkwood Technologies is a mid-sized software development company that recently moved into a
renovated historic building with a disturbing past. Shortly after the move, technical staff begin
reporting strange system behaviors that defy conventional explanation. What begins as minor
anomalies quickly escalates into a full-scale incident that blurs the line between technical
issues and something more sinister.

## Exercise Narrative

The exercise simulates a workday that begins with minor technical oddities and gradually descends
into a full-scale crisis as systems begin exhibiting behaviors that cannot be explained through
normal troubleshooting. The incident response team must maintain their composure while addressing
escalating anomalies that suggest something beyond a conventional cyber attack.

## Exercise Timeline and Scenarios

### Phase 1: Initial Disturbances (0:00-1:00)

#### Setting the Scene (0:00-0:10)

- Master of Ceremonies describes a normal morning at Darkwood Technologies
- Teams are at their workstations beginning routine operations
- Building history is briefly mentioned as having been a former research hospital

#### Scenario 1 (0:10): Strange System Logs

- Security monitoring flags unusual entries in system logs
- Timestamps show events occurring at exactly 3:33 AM across multiple systems
- Log contents include strings of apparently meaningless characters that form patterns when viewed together

*Expected Actions:*

- Begin investigating log anomalies
- Check for potential system time synchronization issues
- Review recent system changes or updates
- Document findings in incident tracking system

#### Scenario 2 (0:30): Employee Reports

- IT support receives multiple calls from employees reporting strange computer behavior
- Reports include monitors briefly displaying inverted colors
- Some users report hearing faint, unexplainable sounds through headphones when no audio is playing
- All affected employees sit in the same area of the building (the former hospital's psychiatric ward)

*Expected Actions:*

- Create incident tickets for the reports
- Dispatch IT support to affected workstations
- Check for environmental factors (power issues, electromagnetic interference)
- Consider malware scanning of affected systems

#### Scenario 3 (0:45): Network Anomalies

- Network monitoring detects data packets being routed through unused portions of the building network
- Traffic analysis shows periodic spikes at 3-minute intervals
- The pattern resembles a heartbeat when graphed
- No explanation can be found in network configuration

*Expected Actions:*

- Activate initial incident response procedures
- Begin investigating network configuration
- Consider isolation of affected network segments
- Begin preparing initial management briefing

### Phase 2: Escalation (1:00-2:00)

#### Scenario 4 (1:00): Disturbing Email Incident

- Employees receive emails from a non-existent internal account
- The sender address contains the name of a doctor who worked in the building decades ago
- Email content includes fragments of old patient records interspersed with binary code
- Attachments are corrupt files that create strange visual artifacts when opened

*Expected Actions:*

- Implement email filtering rules to block similar messages
- Preserve copies of the emails for forensic analysis
- Check email servers for compromise
- Research the historical reference to assess if this is a targeted attack

#### Scenario 5 (1:20): System Compromise

- Security tools detect unauthorized access to the company's database

- Access patterns show systematic exploration of personnel records
- The database queries focus on employees with specific medical conditions

*Expected Actions:*

- Lock out the compromised account
- Begin forensic analysis of the database access
- Consider additional controls on sensitive data
- Inform management about potential data breach

#### Scenario 6 (1:40): Physical Security Anomalies

- Building security systems show doors opening and closing with no one present
